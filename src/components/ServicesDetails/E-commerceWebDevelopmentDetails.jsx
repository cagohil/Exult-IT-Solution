                <h4 className="text-capitalize mb-20"> so what are the types of e-commerce models? </h4>
                <p className="mt-10"> The e-com services between businesses and consumers can be classified broadly in the following four categories: </p>
                <p className="mt-10"> <i className="fas fa-check-circle color-blue5 me-2"></i> <strong className="color-000 "> Business-to-Consumers (B2C) </strong></p>
                <p className="mb-10">
                The most common type of business transaction involves selling products and services to individual consumers. For e.g. – Buying a t-shirt from an online store.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-10"> <i className="fas fa-check-circle color-blue5 me-2"></i> <strong className="color-000 "> Business-to-Business (B2B) </strong></p>
                <p className="mb-10">
                Providing goods and services to other businesses falls under the category of B2B. For e.g. – our professional team developing an eCommerce website for your business.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-10"> <i className="fas fa-check-circle color-blue5 me-2"></i> <strong className="color-000 "> Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C) </strong></p>
                <p className="mb-10">
                Consumers selling their previously purchased items to another consumer. For e.g. – an individual selling their used watch on eBay.
                </p>
                <p className="mt-10"> <i className="fas fa-check-circle color-blue5 me-2"></i> <strong className="color-000 "> Business-to-Business (B2B) </strong></p>
                <p className="mb-30">
                When an individual provides value in the form of goods and services to businesses, it falls under the category of C2B. For e.g. – Blogger providing an affiliate link to a product in exchange for a fixed commission.
                </p>
