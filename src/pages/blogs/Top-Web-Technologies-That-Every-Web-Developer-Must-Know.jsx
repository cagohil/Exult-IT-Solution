As computers cannot speak with one another in the same manner that humans do, they rely on codes. Web technologies are the markup languages and multimedia packages that computers practice to communicate.

                <p className="mb-30">

                <h3 className="text-capitalize mb-20"> 1. Browsers </h3>
                <p className="mb-20">
                  Browsers ask for information and then display it in a manner that we can understand. Consider them to be the web’s analyzers. Some of the most famous browsers are:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-20">
                  <strong>Google Chrome: </strong>By Google
                </p>
                <p className="mb-20">

                <h3 className="text-capitalize mb-20"> 2. HTML & CSS </h3>
                <p className="mb-30">
                One of the fundamental technologies you should learn is HTML. When web browsers receive a request, HTML commands them what to disclose. You should apprehend what CSS is if you want to know better how HTML works. CSS attributes to Cascading Style Sheets, and it specifies how HTML elements should appear on the screen.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-capitalize mb-20"> 3. Web Development Frameworks </h3>
                <p className="mb-30">
                Web development frameworks are gatherings of tools developers can use to skip over monotonous tasks and get directly to work. These include Angular, Ruby on Rails, YII, Meteor Js, Express.js, Zend, and Django.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-capitalize mb-20"> 4. Programming Languages </h3>
                <p className="mb-20">
                As previously said, computers do not apply languages similar to human languages; hence they require a particular method of communication. Below are some of the most broadly used programming languages:
                </p>
                <p className="mb-20">
                  <strong>JavaScript: </strong>practiced by web browsers.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-20">
                  <strong>Coffee Script: </strong>a JavaScript “dialect.”
                </p>
                <p className="mb-20">
                  <strong>Python: </strong>Django’s framework makes use of this.
                </p>

                  <strong>Java: </strong>Android and a large number of desktop programs practice it.
                </p>


                <h3 className="text-capitalize mb-20"> 5. Protocols </h3>
                <p className="mb-20">
                Protocols are the instructions for passing information back and forth between computers and other devices.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-20">
                  <strong>HTTP: </strong>Each website can reach the browser.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-20">
                Other developers can access some of the app’s functionality without sharing the code using an API (application programming interface). Developers expose endpoints, and the API uses an API key to control access. Facebook, Twitter, and Google all provide APIs for their well-designed web services.
                </p>


                <h3 className="text-capitalize mb-20"> 7. Data formats </h3>
                <p className="mb-20">
                A data format is a structure that stores data.
                </p>
                <p className="mb-20">

                </p>
                <p className="mb-20">
