                <h1 className="text-capitalize mb-30"> TYPES OF CRM SYSTEMS </h1>

                <h3 className="text-capitalize mb-20"> CLOUD-BASED CRM </h3>
                <p className="mb-30">
                Cloud computing, often known as Software as a Service, is used in this sort of CRM (SaaS). The data is collected and kept in this system on a separate, external network that employees can access via an internet connection or, in some cases, through third-party service providers. Vendors usually charge users on a subscription basis, with monthly or yearly fees available. Sales force, Hub Spot, and Zen desk are three popular cloud-based CRM providers.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-capitalize mb-20"> ON-PREMISES CRM </h3>
                <p className="mb-30">
                The CRM software is responsible for administering, controlling, security, and maintaining the database and information in this system. The programme is hosted on the company’s servers, and all upgrades are paid for by the user. Therefore, an on-premises deployment may be advantageous for businesses with sophisticated CRM requirements. In addition, many cloud-based CRM companies, such as Sales force and Work Wise, also provide on-premises CRM software.
                </p>

                <h3 className="text-capitalize mb-20"> OPEN SOURCE CRM </h3>
                <p className="mb-20">
                An open-source CRM system makes the source code available to the public, allowing businesses to make changes at no cost to themselves. For example, companies seeking to improve their social CRM practices might use open source CRM solutions to add and customize data linkages on social media channels. OroCRM, Bitrix24, SuiteCRM, and SugarCRM are examples of open-source CRM solutions.
